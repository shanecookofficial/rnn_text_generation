"Oh, the places you'll go!" By: Dr.Seuss

Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!

You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself
any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.

You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.
About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,
you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.

And you may not find any
you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
you'll head straight out of town.

It's opener there
in the wide open air.

Out there things can happen
and frequently do
to people as brainy
and footsy as you.

And then things start to happen,
don't worry. Don't stew.
Just go right along.
You'll start happening too.

OH!
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!

You'll be on y our way up!
You'll be seeing great sights!
You'll join the high fliers
who soar to high heights.

You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.
You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.
Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.

Except when you don't.
Because, sometimes, you won't.

I'm sorry to say so
but, sadly, it's true
that Bang-ups
and Hang-ups
can happen to you.

You can get all hung up
in a prickle-ly perch.
And your gang will fly on.
You'll be left in a Lurch.

You'll come down from the Lurch
with an unpleasant bump.
And the chances are, then,
that you'll be in a Slump.

And when you're in a Slump,
you're not in for much fun.
Un-slumping yourself
is not easily done.

You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.
Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're darked.
A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
How much can you lose? How much can you win?

And IF you go in, should you turn left or right...
or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?
Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.

You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace
and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space,
headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.
The Waiting Place...

...for people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go
or a bus to come, or a plane to go
or the mail to come, or the rain to go
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a Yes or No
or waiting for their hair to grow.
Everyone is just waiting.

Waiting for the fish to bite
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for Friday night
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
Everyone is just waiting.

NO!
That's not for you!

Somehow you'll escape
all that waiting and staying
You'll find the bright places
where Boom Bands are playing.

With banner flip-flapping,
once more you'll ride high!
Ready for anything under the sky.
Ready because you're that kind of a guy!

Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.
And the magical things you can do with that ball
will make you the winning-est winner of all.
Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can be,
with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.

Except when they don't
Because, sometimes they won't.

I'm afraid that some times
you'll play lonely games too.
Games you can't win
'cause you'll play against you.

All Alone!
Whether you like it or not,
Alone will be something
you'll be quite a lot.

And when you're alone, there's a very good chance
you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.
There are some, down the road between hither and yon,
that can scare you so much you won't want to go on.

But on you will go
though the weather be foul.
On you will go
though your enemies prowl.
On you will go
though the Hakken-Kraks howl.
Onward up many
a frightening creek,
though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak.

On and on you will hike,
And I know you'll hike far
and face up to your problems
whatever they are.

You'll get mixed up, of course,
as you already know.
You'll get mixed up
with many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
and remember that Life's
a Great Balancing Act.
Just never foget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.

And will you succeed?
Yes! You will, indeed!
(98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)

KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!

So...
be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray
or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea,
You're off the Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting.
So...get on your way!

"The Lorax" By: Dr.Seuss

At the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows and no
birds ever sing excepting old crows... is the Street of the Lifted Lorax.
And deep in the Grickle-grass, some people say, if you look deep enough you can still see, today, where the
Lorax once stood just as long as it could before somebody lifted the Lorax away.
What was the Lorax? Any why was it there? And why was it lifted and taken somewhere from the far end of
town where the Grickle-grass grows? The old Once-ler still lives here.
Ask him, he knows.
You won't see the Once-ler. Don't knock at his door. He stays in his Lerkim on top of his store. He stays in his
Lerkim, cold under the floor, where he makes his own clothes out of miff-muffered moof. And on special dank
midnights in August, he peeks out of the shutters and sometimes he speaks and tells how the Lorax was lifted
away. He'll tell you, perhaps... if you're willing to pay.
On the end of a rope he lets down a tin pail and you have to toss in fifteen cents and a nail and the shell of a
great-great-great- grandfather snail.
Then he pulls up the pail, makes a most careful count to see if you've paid him the proper amount. Then he
hides what you paid him away in his Snuvv, his secret strange hole in his gruvvulous glove. Then he grunts. I
will call you by Whisper-ma-Phone, for the secrets I tell you are for your ears alone.
SLUPP Down slupps the Whisper-ma-Phone to your ear and the old Once-ler's whispers are not very clear,
since they have to come down through a snergelly hose, and he sounds as if he had smallish bees up his nose.
Now I'll tell you, he says, with his teeth sounding gray, how the Lorax got lifted and taken away... It all started
way back... such a long, long time back...
Way back in the days when the grass was still green and the pond was still wet and the clouds were still clean,
and the song of the Swomee-Swans rang out in space... one morning, I came to this glorious place. And I first
saw the trees! The Truffula Trees! The bright-colored tufts of the Truffula Trees! Mile after mile in the fresh
morning breeze.
And under the trees, I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits as the played in the
shade and ate Truffula Fruits. From the rippulous pond came the comfortable sound of the Humming-Fish
humming while splashing around.
But those trees! Those trees! Those Truffula Trees! All my life I'd been searching for trees such as these. The
touch of their tufts was much softer than silk. And they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk.
I felt a great leaping of joy in my heart. I knew just what I'd do! I unloaded my cart. In no time at all, I had built
a small shop. Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop. And with great skillful skill and with great
speedy speed, I took the soft tuft. And I knitted a Thneed!
The instant I'd finished I heard a ga-Zump! I looked. I saw something pop out of the stump of the tree I'd
chopped down. It was sort of a man. Describe him...That's hard. I don't know if I can. He was shortish, and
oldish, and brownish and mossy. And he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy.
Mister! He said with a sawdusty sneeze, I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees, for the trees
have no tongues. And I'm asking you, sir, at the top of my lungs-- he was very upset as he shouted and puffed--
What's that THING you've made out of my Truffula tuft?
Look, Lorax, I said. There's no cause for alarm. I chopped just one tree. I am doing no harm. I'm being quite
useful. This thing is a Thneed. A Thneed's a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need! It’s a shirt. It's a sock. It's a
glove. It's a hat. But it has other uses. Yes, far beyond that. You can use it for carpets. For pillows! For sheets!
Or curtains! Or covers for bicycle seats! The Lorax said, Sir! You are crazy with greed. There is no one on earth
who would buy that fool Thneed!
But the very next minute I proved he was wrong. For, just at that minute, a chap came along, and he thought
that the Thneed I had knitted was great. He happily bought it for three ninety-eight. I laughed at the Lorax, You
poor stupid guy! You never can tell what some people will buy.
I repeat, cried the Lorax, I speak for the trees!
I'm busy, I told him. Shut up, if you please. I rushed 'cross the room, and in no time at all, built a radiophone. I
put in a quick call. I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts and I said, listen here! Here's a wonderful
chance for the whole Once-ler Family to get mighty rich! Get over here fast! Take the road to North Nitch. Turn
left at Weehawken. Sharp right at South Stitch.
And, in no time at all, in the factory I built, the whole Once-ler Family was working full tilt. We were all knitting
Thneed’s just as busy as bees, to the sound of the chopping of Truffula Trees.
Then... Oh! Baby! Oh! How my business did grow! Now, chopping one tree at a time was too slow. So I quickly
invented my Super-Axe-Hacker, which whacked off four Truffula Trees at one smacker. We were making
Thneed’s four times as fast as before! And that Lorax?... He didn't show up any more.
But the next week he knocked on my new office door. He snapped! I'm the Lorax who speaks for the trees,
which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please. But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots, who
played in the shade in their Bar-ba-loot suits and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits. NOW...thanks to your
hacking my trees to the ground, there's not enough Truffula Fruit to go 'round.
And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies!
They loved living here. But I can't let them stay. They'll have to find food. And I hope that they may. Good luck,
boys, he cried. And he sent them away.
I, the Once-ler, felt sad as I watched them all go. BUT... business is business! And business must grow
regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.
I meant no harm. I most truly did not. But I had to grow bigger. So bigger I got. I biggered my factory. I
biggered my roads. I biggered my wagons. I biggered the loads of the Thneed’s I shipped out. I was shipping
them forth to the South! To the East! To the West! To the North! I went right on biggering...selling more
Thneed’s. And I biggered my money, which everyone needs.
Then again he came back! I was fixing some pipes when that old nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes. I
am the Lorax, he coughed and he whiffed. He sneezed and he snuffled. He snarggled. He sniffed. Once-ler! He
cried with a cruffulous croak. Once-ler! You're making such smogulous smoke!
My poor Swomee-Swans...why, they can't sing a note! No one can sing who has smog in his throat. And so, said
the Lorax, --please pardon my cough-- they cannot live here. So I'm sending them off. Where will they go? I
don't hopefully know. They may have to fly for a month...or a year... To escape from the smog you've smoggedup around here.
What's more, snapped the Lorax. (His dander was up.) Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp.
Your machinery chugs on, day and night without stop making Gluppity-Glupp. Also Schloppity-Schlopp. And
what do you do with this leftover goo? I'll show you. You dirty old Once-ler man, you!
You're glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish hummed! No more can they hum, for their gills are all
gummed. So I'm sending them off. Oh, their future is dreary. They'll walk on their fins and get woefully weary
in search of some water that isn't so smeary.
And then I got mad. I got terribly mad. I yelled at the Lorax, Now listen here, Dad! All you do is yap-yap and
say, Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Well, I have my rights, sir, and I'm telling you I intend to go on doing just what I do!
And, for your information, you Lorax, I'm figgering on biggering and Biggering and BIGGERING and
BIGGERING!! Turning MORE Truffula Trees into Thneed’s which everyone, EVERYONE, EVERYONE
needs!
And at that very moment, we heard a loud whack! From outside in the fields came a sickening smack of an axe
on a tree. Then we heard the tree fall. The very last Truffula Tree of them all! No more trees. No more Thneed’s.
No more work to be done. So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one, all waved my good-bye. They jumped
into my cars and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars.
Now all that was left beneath the bad-smelling sky was my big empty factory... the Lorax... and I.
The Lorax said nothing. Just gave me a glance... just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance... as he lifted
himself by the seat of his pants. And I'll never forget the grim look on his face when he hoisted himself and took
leave of this place, through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace. And all that the Lorax left here in this
mess was a small pile of rocks, with one word... UNLESS.
Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess.
That was long, long ago. But each day since that day I've sat here and worried and worried away. Through the
years, while my buildings have fallen apart, I've worried about it with all of my heart.
But now, says the Once-ler, Now that you're here, the word of the Lorax seems
perfectly clear. UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is
going to get better. It's not.
SO... Catch! Calls the Once-ler. He lets something fall. It's a Truffula Seed. It's the last one of all! You're in
charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds. And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs. Plant a new Truffula.
Treat it with care. Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air. Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack. Then
the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.

"There's a Wocket in my Pocket" By: Dr.Seuss

Did you
ever have the feeling
there’s a WASKET
in your BASKET
or a NUREAU
in your BUREAU?
Or a WOSET in your CLOSET?
sometimes
I feel quite CERTAIN
there’s a JERTAIN
in the CURTAIN.
sometimes
I have a feeling there’s a ZLOCK
behind the ClOCK.
and that ZELF
up on that SHELF!
I have
talked to him
myself.
That’s the
Kind of house
I live in.
There’s a NINK
in the SINK.
and a
ZAMP
in the LAMP
and they’re rather nice
…I think
Some of them
are very friendly.
like the YOT
in the POT.
But that
YOTTLE
In the BOTTLE!
Some are friendly
some are NOT.
I like the ZABLE
on the TABLE
and the GHAIR under the CHAIR
but the BOFA
on the SOFA..
Well,
I wish
he wasn’t there.
ALL those NUPBOARDS
in the CUPBOARDS,
they’re good fun
to have about.
But the NOOTH GRUSH
on my
TOOTH BRUSH…
him
I could
do without!
The only one
I’m really scared of
is that VUG
under the RUG.
And that Quimney
up the CHIMNEY
I don’t like him
not at all
And it makes me sort of nervous
when the ZALL scoots down the HALL.
But the YEPS
on the STEPSthey’re great fun to have around
and so are many, many other friends
that I have found.
Like the TELLAR, and the NELLAR, and the GELLAR
and the GELLAR and the DELLAR and the BELLAR
and the WELLAR and the ZELLAR in the CELLAR.
And the Geiling on the CEILING
and the ZOWER in my SHOWER…
and the ZILLOW
on my PILLOW.
I don’t care if you believe it
that’s the kind of house
I live in
and I hope
we never leave it.
